# Global-Gender-Pay-Gap-Index
**Concern-What is the extent of Gender pay gap globally over the years?**</br>
                  *-Using Web scraping techniques and EDA to analyse the Gender pay difference across nations* 


## The Problem
An article in Fortune magazine is celebrating April 10, 2018 as **Equal Pay Day** that marks the fact that how far into 2018 does an average American women has to work to be at par in her earnings with the average US man in 2017. Many continue to ignore the existence of gender pay gap but in reality it exists and it impacts the nation's global development. The statistics state that women earn 77.9 cents for every dollar earned by men *(The Gender Pay Gap Persists, Payscale-2018)* and this gap continues to increase at higher levels of the talent pool. 

## Project Summary
So, with this background of the problem, I will be looking into the historic evidence of this gender pay gap across countries and regions, to understand its trends. This would be my preliminary approach after which I would be exploring the factors worldwide that are contributing to this wide pay gap despite globalisation and economic development.
