# Global Gender Pay Gap Index

                  

## The Problem
An article in Fortune magazine is celebrating April 10, 2018 as **Equal Pay Day** that marks the fact that how far into 2018 does an average American women has to work to be at par in her earnings with the average US man in 2017. Many continue to ignore the existence of gender pay gap but in reality it exists and it impacts the nation's global development. The statistics state that women earn 77.9 cents for every dollar earned by men *(The Gender Pay Gap Persists, Payscale-2018)* and this gap continues to increase at higher levels of the talent pool. 

**Problem Statement-Globally, which countries contribute heavily or majorly impact Gender Pay Gap?**</br>

## Project Summary
**1) Data Source:** To address this problem statement I will be using the open source data on Gender Pay Gap available with **[OECD](http://www.oecd.org/about/) (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)**. I will exploring and analysing the following indicators to build a prediction model-</br>
**a) [Average Wages](https://data.oecd.org/earnwage/average-wages.htm#indicator-chart)**-This indicator is measured in USD      constant prices using 2016 base year. It is calculated by dividing the national-accounts-based total wage bill by the average number of employees in the total economy, which is then multiplied by the ratio of the average usual weekly hours per full-time employee to the average usually weekly hours for all employees. </br>
**b) [Employee Compensation by Activity](https://data.oecd.org/earnwage/employee-compensation-by-activity.htm#indicator-chart)**-This data considers two components which include wages payable in cash and value of social contribution payable to employees. This indicator is broken down by agriculture (including forestry and fishing), industry and services and is measured as the gross value added. </br>
**c) [Gender Wage Gap](https://data.oecd.org/earnwage/gender-wage-gap.htm#indicator-chart)**- This indicator is defined as the difference between median earnings of men and women relative to median earnings of men. </br>
**d) [Wage Levels](https://data.oecd.org/earnwage/wage-levels.htm#indicator-chart)**-Wage levels are defines as High pay and Low pay and is measured as a percentage. The incidence of low pay refers to the share of workers earning less than two-thirds of median earnings . The incidence of high pay refers to the share of workers earning more than one-and-a-half time median earnings. </br>

**2) Aim the Project:**
**-Aim:** To identify the top five countries contributing to Global Gender Pay Gap and predict their influence for the next 5 years.
I will be using Machine Learning methods to build identify the countries majorly contributing to the Gender Pay Gap based on the indicators and build a prediction model to follow their impact on the trend of GPG for next 5 years.
